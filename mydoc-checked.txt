can't I get some peace. I was walking down the rode when suddenly a man said xylophone. I said what was that saxophone? he said, no you are really very dumb. I need to drive my rocket down the the supermarket on the planet jupiter. there I will find a jolly man to fill my basket with precents. Then I will sail to the grate island to bodylandia where I will meet the person who eats shoes. The main who eats shoes? how can he be! He must have the intestinal track and digestive system of a wolly mammoth! He has no food... answered the man.
